# HyperPara_Opt

Features of Hyperparameter Optimization

    Grid Search: The code utilizes grid search, which exhaustively searches through all specified parameter combinations. It tests different values for parameters like the number of estimators, maximum depth, and criterion, allowing you to find the optimal settings for your random forest classifier.

    Randomized Search: In addition to grid search, the code demonstrates the use of randomized search. This technique randomly samples a subset of the parameter space, making it more efficient for large parameter grids. By specifying the range of values for parameters like the number of estimators, maximum depth, and criterion, you can explore a broader search space.

    Scoring Metric: The code uses accuracy as the scoring metric to evaluate the models. However, you can modify it to use other metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score, depending on the problem at hand.

    Cross-Validation: To obtain reliable performance estimates, the code employs 5-fold cross-validation during the search process. This technique divides the data into five subsets and iteratively trains and evaluates the model on different combinations of training and validation sets.

    Model Selection: Once the searches are complete, the code prints the best score achieved and the corresponding best estimator's hyperparameters. This information helps you understand which combination of hyperparameters yields the highest performance for your random forest classifier.

    Flexibility: The code can be easily adapted to work with different datasets and models. Simply replace the input data and modify the hyperparameter grids according to your specific requirements.
